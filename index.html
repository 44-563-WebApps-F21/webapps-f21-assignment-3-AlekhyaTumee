       <h3>Graph-Flows Algorithm</h3>
       <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">In computer science, the Edmonds–Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network in {\displaystyle O(|V||E|^{2})}{\displaystyle O(|V||E|^{2})} time. 
           The algorithm was first published by Yefim Dinitz (whose name is also transliterated "E. A. Dinic", notably as author of his early papers) in 1970[1][2] and independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972.
            Dinic's algorithm includes additional techniques that reduce the running time to {\displaystyle O(|V|^{2}|E|)}{\displaystyle O(|V|^{2}|E|)}
