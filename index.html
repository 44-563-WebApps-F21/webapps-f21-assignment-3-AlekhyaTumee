        <h3>My favourite place in the world is Hyderabad.</h3>
        <p>I was born and brought up in Hyderabad which known as **City of Pearls** it is also known as **City of Biryani**. Charminar is a famous monument in hyderabad .I love the vibes that charminar gives me, whenever i was stressed out i used to roam the streets of charminar.
           It made me forget all my stress and the taste of Hyderabad biryani is incomparable, no other city's biryani is as tasty as Hyderabad Biryani.Hyderabad is very beautiful and magical and that's the reason why i love my place hyderabad.</p>
